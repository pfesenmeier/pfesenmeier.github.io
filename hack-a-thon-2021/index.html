        <p>This spring, A couple colleagues and I began to work through <a href="https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/">The Discovery Book</a>, an introduction to embedded development in Rust. A few months into the book, I attended the SEP summer hackathon to use the lessons and code from the book to create a thermometer.</p>
<p>Last year, I had built a thermostat to turn a mini-fridge into a fermentation chamber. The thermostat ran on a Raspberry Pi, which connected to a Meros Smart Outlet and a SHT31D temperature and humidity sensor from Adafruit. The software was from the (then Mozilla) Webthings Framework. </p>

<p>It was fun and it worked pretty well! But I felt provisioning a tiny Linux box for a thermostat seemed a bit overkill. Enter: the STM32FDISCOVERY.</p>
<img src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pfesenmeier.github.io&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;ba9aba4cd7aeda3b00.jpg" />
<p>My STM32DISCOVERY programs are running on bare metal: no operating system, files, Wifi, etc.. The Discovery authors provided a way to flash the program onto the board, debug the program as it runs on board, and capture log and error messages.</p>
<p>My goal for the weekend was to hook up and read from the SHT31D sensor. I split up the work in incremental steps.</p>
<p>First, I wanted to see my board communicate over I2C, the protocol the temperature sensors use. The easiest way was to get the board to read off of its on-board magnetometer. After a few tweaks to the Discovery book's example for my newer revision of the board, I got some readings:</p>
<img src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pfesenmeier.github.io&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;7f3fb2553d63c5d900.jpg" />
<p>Second step: read from my colleague's Bosh BME280 sensor, which had a more popular open-source package than my SHT31D. There was an issue with the library: the factory function that produced the sensor object consumed a delay object. This meant when I tried to use the delay object to pause between readings, I would get an error like this: </p>
<img src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pfesenmeier.github.io&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;57b34dc9c34365fd00.png" />
<p>Rust does not allow for multiple mutable references. There was a pull request to solve the issue that had not been merged in a year. Luckily, cargo provides an easy way to bring in the code of this PR straight from Github:</p>
<img src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pfesenmeier.github.io&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;55fdac40601d997000.png" />
<p>Third step: Use the SHT31D. This was straightforward, save for some minor wire repair.</p>
<p>Having accomplished my goal on Saturday, I decided to answer a question that seemed solvable with my remaining time: can the board read from both sensors at the same time?</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/i2c-addresses#i2c-inter-integrated-circuit-communications-2630755-2">Adafruit explains</a> I2C buses have one master and one to many slaves existing on the same line.  Would the embedded-rust ecosystem allow it? At first glance: no. </p>
<p>Bringing in both sensors in a program, both required the I2C bus object. Only one could have it, else I get an error. Luckily spotted in a Github thread: the shared-bus crate. This one could manage the references to the bus:</p>
<img src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pfesenmeier.github.io&#x2F;processed_images&#x2F;04a832e78b11f6d600.png" />
<p>In the end, I was able to read from both temperature sensors at the same time, on the same connection. I was pleasantly surprised to see both sensors giving similar readings.</p>
<p>That was my weekend! Had a blast, looking forward to the next one.</p>
<p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/pfesenmeier/discovery">my fork</a> of the Discovery Book, in folders <code>src/9{7-9}-.+</code></p>
