Goal is to capture coding history.
History is my shell and browser search history.
One problem is combining history to happen in chronological order.
Chrome history has timestamps.
Chrome history can be downloaded from myaccount.google.com - in json format
bash history can be formatted to include timestamps... which is already setup for me when run 'history'... also is an used setting with oh my bash... on by default in Ubuntu, it seems?


first step: print out all history for given day
- print out all bash history
- filter for just today
- print out all chrome history
- filter for just today
- print out both today, just in chronological order
