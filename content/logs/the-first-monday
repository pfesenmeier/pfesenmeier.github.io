If not ESPN first thing, what?
Answer: Work email, then Slack. then Calendar.
They put in a lot of work to make a first impression of being all things to all people. And failed after a while.

# Todo

Do I have any pending reviews? No. Now all my reviews are marked as complete.
What story was I working on last?

# Talking through a story

The publisher sends a request to the backend with metadata ...
And the subscribers will receive the message if the request passes their filter.
To make this work, the publisher sends the attribute, the subscriber filters for the attribute. The storage remains the same.

New endpoint. New backend function for endpoint. Same messaging system, just modified: other endpoint / function begins sending and filtering for new message attribute, this endpoint / function for another attribute.

Does the 'subscription' apply to the provider and the consumer, or the provider and the message storage, or the message storage and the consumer?

Almost researched the question by looking at the front page of the NYT.

Is the storage subsribing? 
Answer: no. Nothing subscribes. A subscription subscribes. A subscription has a reference to a provider and a message storage.

Does the filter only happen at subscription level? Or does subscription only happen between provider and storage, Or also between storage and consumer?
The storage / function communicate through events with a storage property

# Proposal

We update a -> b -> c -> d -> e to
to pass metadata .foo
filter for this 

Then 
f -> g -> **c** -> i-> j

again, why NYT. Do I want to see something that would support abandoning my current line of thinking, indulge my doubts about it?
